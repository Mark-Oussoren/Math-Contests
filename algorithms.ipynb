    "# 1 - The Role of Algorithms in Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm (informal)**: any well defined computational procedure that takes in some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorting Problem**: Input - a sequence of $n$ numbers $\\{a_1,\\dots,a_n\\}$. Output - a permutation (reordering) $\\{a_1',\\dots,a_n'\\}$ of the input sequence such that $a_1'\\leq \\cdots\\leq a_n'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter simply introduces the reader to a variety of algorithms that will be subsequently discussed while discussing real-world applications of such algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-1**: Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: In the space of machine-learning, we may be interested in learning decision boundaries from the class of convex polygons and thus finding the convex hull for the positive or negative labels is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-2**: Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Accuracy - if all known algorithms for a particular problem are not correct, we may be more interested in which yields the most correct instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-3**: Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Arrays - represents unordered set of values. Strengths: ease of access to elements, less code compared with writing out variables, contiguous memory, etc. Weaknesses: insertion/deletion requires shifting neighboring elements, C-arrays require only one data type for the entire array, memory is fixed (pro and con), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-4**: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: They are both optimization problems that minimize some objective function pertaining to the Euclidean distance. The shortest-path is efficiently solvable while the traveling-salesman is not. The traveling salesman (in industry) also features gas consumption costs which weight the ordering/pathing of the driver - logistical costs to the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-5**: Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is \"approximately\" the best is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Best solution - many industrial problems pertaining to machine automation require exact solutions. Approximate solution - recommendation system problems - online shopping, movies, workout plans, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-1**: Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: This is a weird general question. Google search is an example application. It utilizes an algorithm that ranks pages according to a search query provided by the user. Not sure if this answered the question...\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-2**: Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $n$, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge sort runs in $64n\\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: $64n\\lg n=8n^2\\iff 2^{1/8}=n^{1/n}\\iff n=1.1$. Thus for $n=1$, insertion sort edges out merge sort, but loses in all other scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-3**: What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: 14 - numerically checking... didn't feel like using Lambert functions."

    "In section 2.2, the author declares that we work with a generic one-processor random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In this way, instructions are carried out one after the other (nothing in parallel). The way analysis works is that we have some cost per line of code, denoted $c_i$ for the $i$th line, and with this line, there are a certain number of times that we execute that line say $n$ times and thus our computation cost for this particular line of code is $c_i\\times n$ - simple. The book focuses on the worst case running times. Distributions of running times for a particular algorithm is interesting and will be touched on later ~chapter 5 I think.  \n",

Then find the second smallest element of $A$, and exchange it with $A[2]$. Continue in this manner for the first $n-1$ elements of $A$. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as **selection sort**. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first $n-1$ elements, rather than for all $n$ elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in $\\Theta$-notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: For $i\\in[n-1]$, this algorithm maintains that $A[j]\\leq A[i]$ for $j<i$. It need only run for the first $n-1$ elements as finding the $(n-1)$th smallest element implies what the $n$th smallest is and so the $(n-1)$ and $n$th element are permuted if need be but in the correct order. Best and worst case are the same - $\\Theta(n^2)$ as each time we need to ensure that the element is indeed the $i$th smallest - so $(n-1)n/2$ calls needed for the inner loop.\n",
