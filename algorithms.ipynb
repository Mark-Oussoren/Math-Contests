    "With free time, I run through exercises in \"Introduction to Algorithms\" by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein. These solutions are my own and thus there may be the occasional mishap. I assume in addition to my answers, I will provide short summaries of the methodologies discussed if I find the chapter interesting.

    "# 1 - The Role of Algorithms in Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm (informal)**: any well defined computational procedure that takes in some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorting Problem**: Input - a sequence of $n$ numbers $\\{a_1,\\dots,a_n\\}$. Output - a permutation (reordering) $\\{a_1',\\dots,a_n'\\}$ of the input sequence such that $a_1'\\leq \\cdots\\leq a_n'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter simply introduces the reader to a variety of algorithms that will be subsequently discussed while discussing real-world applications of such algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-1**: Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: In the space of machine-learning, we may be interested in learning decision boundaries from the class of convex polygons and thus finding the convex hull for the positive or negative labels is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-2**: Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Accuracy - if all known algorithms for a particular problem are not correct, we may be more interested in which yields the most correct instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-3**: Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Arrays - represents unordered set of values. Strengths: ease of access to elements, less code compared with writing out variables, contiguous memory, etc. Weaknesses: insertion/deletion requires shifting neighboring elements, C-arrays require only one data type for the entire array, memory is fixed (pro and con), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-4**: How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: They are both optimization problems that minimize some objective function pertaining to the Euclidean distance. The shortest-path is efficiently solvable while the traveling-salesman is not. The traveling salesman (in industry) also features gas consumption costs which weight the ordering/pathing of the driver - logistical costs to the objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1-5**: Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is \"approximately\" the best is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Best solution - many industrial problems pertaining to machine automation require exact solutions. Approximate solution - recommendation system problems - online shopping, movies, workout plans, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-1**: Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: This is a weird general question. Google search is an example application. It utilizes an algorithm that ranks pages according to a search query provided by the user. Not sure if this answered the question...\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-2**: Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $n$, insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge sort runs in $64n\\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: $64n\\lg n=8n^2\\iff 2^{1/8}=n^{1/n}\\iff n=1.1$. Thus for $n=1$, insertion sort edges out merge sort, but loses in all other scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2-3**: What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: 14 - numerically checking... didn't feel like using Lambert functions."

It includes checking 1) **initialization**: it is true prior to the first iteration of the loop, 2) **maintenance**: if it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration, and 3) **termination**: when the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.\n",

    "- Maintenance: The book says we should make a separate loop invariant statement for the inner while loop. Intuitively, we are clear here as we simply compare the current iterate against the prior $1,\\dots,j-1$ until the while statement breaks - it will consist of the same elements, just relabeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Termination: The algorithm ends if $j>A.$length$=n$, so $j=n+1$ from which we gather that the key is indeed the last element of $A$.\n",
