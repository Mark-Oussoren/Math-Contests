On the other hand, **combinations** tell us the number of arrangements where the order does not matter - i.e. how many salads can I make with these ingredients (the order in which you put the ingredients in the salad here does not influence the salad you end up with).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer**: This one is pretty tricky for a high school contest haha. We employ the principles of counting: 1) fix a spot at the table, 2) for this spot, there are three napkins to choose from, 3) going around the table in a circle, this means that for the next spot we have 2 napkins that are distinct from the previous one, 4) the same is true for the next $n-2$ diners (there are two napkins that are distinct from the one that came before it) and so we employ the multiplicative rule to obtain $3\\cdot 2^{n-1}$ where $n$ again denotes the number of diners. HOWEVER, this overcounts the number of arrangements!! In actuality, the last seat does not have 2 napkins to choose from  because this includes the case where the first and last diner (paired together as it's a circle) share the same color napkin. How do we remedy this? Well this is where the CRUX is - the count of cases where the first and last napkin are the same is the same problem as if the first and last napkin were the same node/edge - in other words, the count is the same as the total orderings for $n-1$ seats. \n",

Then without loss of generality, assume that $a$ is nearest to the side $x'y'$, then the triangle $\\Delta xya$ has a larger area than $\\Delta xyz$ as its altitude is trivially larger.
